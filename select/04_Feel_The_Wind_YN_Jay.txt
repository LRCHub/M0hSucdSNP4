The life of a young boss.
Rich before 21
You know what I'm saying, I had a million dollars when I was 20
You feel me?
Ay, I could feel the wind
I asked God to forgive me, then I sin again
Ay, I wanna win again
Young niggas hanging chops out of tinted vans
Spin once, if they ain't dead, I tell them, "spin again"
I rock Amiri, I remember rocking Citi Trend
Hold on, that was a city trend
Ay, I could feel the air
Get so high I'm right here but forget I'm there
I can't feelings for- damn (you talking about like feelings?)
I can't catch feelings for a bitch I'll forget I cared
This ain't happened overnight
I swear I had to wait for this shit
I swear I had to wait for this shit
I swear I had to wait for this shit
I swear I had to wait for this shit
She ain't let me fuck first night
I swear I had to wait for that shit
I swear I had to wait for that shit
I swear I had to wait for that shit
I swear I had to wait for that
Bitch, I made it to the top, I had to wait for that shit
I want my food cooked, I had to wait for that shit
Baby get off work at 9, I had to wait for my bitch
Me and my girl full, like I ate with my bitch
Four pockets full, 4PF, but I ain't Lil Baby
Riding 'round with seven sum' pounds like a lil' baby
At the crib, sucking on some tiddies, like a lil' baby
I don't call my bitch my girlfriend, that's my lil' baby
Got a short girl that's cuckoo, she a lil' crazy
Middle school, tryna go to prom, I ain't go to Sadie's
Every time I fuck, I wrap it up, 'cause I don't want no babies
Every day I thank God for Priscilla, you don't know my auntie
[Girl, you need some lotion on your arm, you got auntie elbows
My young nigga know jiujitsu, he throw eighteen elbows
Selling coochie runts in Atlanta, I got ATL 'bows (ha, what the fuck?)
Nigga pulled up with some fake Gucci, like, that can't be real, bro
Up early before the store open, like, they can't be still closed
Up close, looking at your jewelry, like that can't be real gold
Bought an outfit, I'm at Neiman's like I can't be real cold
(Like you in Neiman's Marcus or like you anemic?)
